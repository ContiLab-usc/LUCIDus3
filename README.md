# LUCIDus 3.0.3: LUCID with Multiple Omics Data 

This repository contains the source code for LUCIDus 3.0.3.

The **LUCIDus** package implements the statistical method LUCID originally proposed in the research paper [A Latent Unknown Clustering Integrating
Multi-Omics Data (LUCID) with Phenotypic Traits](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz667)
(*Bioinformatics*, 2020). LUCID conducts integrated clustering by using multi-view data, including genetic or environmental exposures, and omics data with/without outcome. **LUCIDus** features variable selection, incorporating missingness in omics data, visualization of the LUCID model via Sankey diagram, bootstrap inference, and functions for tuning model parameters. We then extended the single-omic LUCID model to multi-omics.

LUCID version 3.0.1, a major update and enhancement from the original release, implements different integration strategies for multi-omics data with multiple layers including LUCID early integration, LUCID in parallel, and LUCID in serial. It also incorporates methods to deal with missingness in multi-omics data. The following DAG illustrates the three different LUCID models for three integration strategies.
